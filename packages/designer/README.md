### Stop Coding Layouts Blindly.

You know the process. You need to generate a PDF invoice. You open your editor and start writing code like `` `doc.text('Total:', 400, 750)` ``. You save, re-run your script, and check the output. The text is a few pixels off. You go back, guess a new coordinate, and repeat the cycle. It's slow, frustrating, and completely disconnected from the visual nature of the task.

The alternative is often worse: fighting with print CSS to convert HTML to a PDF, only to end up with a low-quality, blurry document that looks terrible on a professional invoice or a thermal printer receipt.

**AavanamKit is designed to fix this broken workflow.**

### A Visual Development Tool for Documents

AavanamKit is a complete ecosystem that treats document layouts not as a coding chore, but as a visual design process.

Our core philosophy is simple: **Design your document visually first, then use the exported JSON as your production-ready template.**

Instead of guessing at coordinates, you use our powerful visual designer to draw your layout. You see exactly how it will look in real-time. When you're done, you export a clean JSON object that represents your entire design. This JSON **is your layout code**, ready to be used by our headless backend engine.

The demo comes pre-loaded with a gallery of professional templates for a mobile repair shop, showcasing the versatility of the designer:

- **A full A4 Service Invoice**: A standard, comprehensive invoice perfect for detailed billing.
- **A compact A5 Invoice**: A modern, stylish design for smaller jobs or quotes.
- **A continuous-roll Thermal Receipt**: Demonstrates the "Roll Mode" for printers with dynamic paper length.
- **A small Job Repair Ticket**: A custom-sized ticket for internal tracking and customer claims.

You can access these templates by clicking the **"New from Template"** button in the demo. The complete source code for these templates can be found in `packages/designer/src/lib/templates.js`.



## ‚ú® The AavanamKit Ecosystem

AavanamKit is a monorepo containing two distinct but perfectly synchronized packages:

### üé® `@aavanamkit/designer` (Your Visual Dev Tool)
A powerful, embeddable **React component** that provides a full WYSIWYG "design studio." Use it in your local development environment to visually build and export your document templates.

- **Complete Visual Canvas:** A full WYSIWYG experience. Drag, drop, resize, rotate, and style every element with an intuitive properties panel.
- **Powerful Data Binding:** Visually map any element's property to your application's data schema. The designer intelligently flattens complex, nested JSON for easy use.
- **Advanced Components Built-In:** Go beyond simple text and images with a powerful, **auto-paginating Table** that handles page breaks automatically, plus support for Barcodes and various Shapes.
- **Total Page Control:** Full control over your document's layout. Choose standard sizes like A4/Letter, define custom dimensions, switch between portrait/landscape, or use the **Continuous Roll** mode for dynamic-height thermal printer receipts.
- **Professional Workflow Tools:** Speed up your design process with keyboard shortcuts, canvas zoom & pan, and a built-in gallery of production-ready templates to start from.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Easily set rules to show or hide elements based on your live data (e.g., only show a "Discount Applied" label if `discount > 0`).
- **Pre-Printed Stationery Support:** Upload an image of your pre-printed paper as a background to perfectly align your digital design with your physical media.
- **Instant JSON Export:** Get a clean, production-ready template JSON with one click.

 

## üì¶ Installation

Install the designer in your React project using npm:

```bash
npm install @aavanamkit/designer
```

---

## üîß Usage

Import the `AavanamKit` component and its required, pre-built CSS file. You control the designer by passing it your application's data schema and wiring up the `onSave` callback to your backend.

```tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import AavanamKit from '@aavanamkit/designer';
import '@aavanamkit/designer/dist/AavanamKit.css';

function MyTemplateEditor() {
  const myAppSchema = {
    customer: { name: "string", address: "string" },
    invoiceNumber: "string",
    items: [{ description: "string", total: "number" }]
  };

  const [template, setTemplate] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // fetchTemplateFromApi().then(savedTemplate => setTemplate(savedTemplate));
  }, []);

  const handleSave = async (newTemplate) => {
    console.log("Saving template to database:", newTemplate);
    // await saveTemplateToApi(newTemplate);
  };

  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh', width: '100%' }}>
      <AavanamKit
        schema={myAppSchema}
        template={template}
        onSave={handleSave}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

# The Bonus: Safe Client Empowerment

And if you want to go the extra mile, you can then embed the same `` `@aavanamkit/designer` `` component into your application's admin panel. This allows your clients to safely handle their own **visual** changes without ever needing to touch the underlying data structure.

**What clients *can* do:**
- Change element positions (move the logo, rearrange footer text).
- Adjust styling (font sizes, colors, bold/italics).
- Upload their own images, including using a scan of their **pre-printed stationery as a background** to perfectly align their design.

**What clients *cannot* do:**
- They **cannot** change the data schema or the data bindings. The core data structure is controlled by you, the developer, ensuring data integrity is always maintained.
