### How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to the AavanamKit project.

- **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please ensure it hasn't already been reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jafranjemal/aavanamkit/issues).

### ðŸš€ Submitting a Pull Request

Ready to contribute code? Hereâ€™s how to set up your fork and submit a pull request:

1.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix. All work should be done on a branch created from our `develop` branch.
    ```bash
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature
    ```

2.  **Make your changes** to the code. Ensure you are following the style guides.

3.  **Run tests** to ensure you haven't broken anything.
    ```bash
    npm test --workspace=@aavanamkit/engine
    ```

4.  **Commit your changes** with a descriptive, conventional commit message (see below).
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat(designer): Add support for PNG export"
    ```

5.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/amazing-new-feature
    ```

6.  **Open a Pull Request** from your fork to the **`develop` branch** of the main AavanamKit repository. Please provide a clear description of the changes and link to any relevant issues.

### âœ¨ Style Guides

#### Code Style
We use **Prettier** to maintain a consistent code style across the project. Please ensure you run it before committing your changes. You can format all files by running:
```bash
npm run format
```
*(Note: We will need to add a "format" script to our root `package.json` for this to work.)*

### Commit Messages
We follow the **Conventional Commits** specification. This helps us automate versioning and generate changelogs. Your commit messages should be structured as follows:

```<type>[optional scope]: <description>```

- **`feat`**: A new feature.
- **`fix`**: A bug fix.
- **`docs`**: Documentation only changes.
- **`style`**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc).
- **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
- **`chore`**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

**Example:** `` `feat(engine): Add support for PNG export` ``

Thank you again for your contribution!
