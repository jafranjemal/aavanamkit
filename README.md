## Stop Coding Layouts Blindly.

You know the process. You need to generate a PDF invoice. You open your editor and start writing code like `` `doc.text('Total:', 400, 750)` ``. You save, re-run your script, and check the output. The text is a few pixels off. You go back, guess a new coordinate, and repeat the cycle. It's slow, frustrating, and completely disconnected from the visual nature of the task.

The alternative is often worse: fighting with print CSS to convert HTML to a PDF, only to end up with a low-quality, blurry document that looks terrible on a professional invoice or a thermal printer receipt.

**AavanamKit is designed to fix this broken workflow.**

### A Visual Development Tool for Documents

AavanamKit is a complete ecosystem that treats document layouts not as a coding chore, but as a visual design process.

Our core philosophy is simple: **Design your document visually first, then use the exported JSON as your production-ready template.**

Instead of guessing at coordinates, you use our powerful visual designer to draw your layout. You see exactly how it will look in real-time. When you're done, you export a clean JSON object that represents your entire design. This JSON **is your layout code**, ready to be used by our headless backend engine.

### ‚ú® The AavanamKit Ecosystem

AavanamKit is a monorepo containing two distinct but perfectly synchronized packages:

### üé® `@aavanamkit/designer` (Your Visual Dev Tool)
A powerful, embeddable **React component** that provides a full WYSIWYG "design studio." Use it in your local development environment to visually build and export your document templates.

- **Complete Visual Canvas:** A full WYSIWYG experience. Drag, drop, resize, rotate, and style every element with an intuitive properties panel.
- **Powerful Data Binding:** Visually map any element's property (like text content or color) to your application's data schema. The designer intelligently flattens complex, nested JSON for easy use.
- **Advanced Components Built-In:** Go beyond simple text and images with a powerful, **auto-paginating Table** that handles page breaks automatically, plus support for Barcodes and various Shapes.
- **Total Page Control:** Full control over your document's layout. Choose standard sizes like A4/Letter, define custom dimensions, switch between portrait/landscape, or use the **Continuous Roll** mode for dynamic-height thermal printer receipts.
- **Professional Workflow Tools:** Speed up your design process with keyboard shortcuts, canvas zoom & pan, and a built-in gallery of production-ready templates to start from.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Easily set rules to show or hide elements based on your live data (e.g., only show a "Discount Applied" label if `discount > 0`).
- **Pre-Printed Stationery Support:** Upload an image of your pre-printed paper as a background to perfectly align your digital design with your physical media.
- **Instant JSON Export:** Get a clean, production-ready template JSON with one click.

**[ &raquo; Learn more about the Designer ](./packages/designer/README.md)**

### ‚öôÔ∏è `@aavanamkit/engine` (Your Backend Powerhouse)
A pure, **headless Node.js library** with zero browser dependencies. It takes the templates you create with the designer, merges them with your live data, and generates high-quality, native vector PDFs and DOCX files.

- High-Fidelity Output: Solves the quality problem of HTML-to-PDF converters.
- Automated: Perfect for API responses, scheduled jobs, or sending email attachments.
- Robust: Intelligently handles missing template properties to prevent crashes.

### üì¶ Quick Start: The Developer Workflow

### Step 1: Design Your Template Visually

Run the `` `@aavanamkit/designer` `` locally (or use our live demo). Design your invoice, bind it to your data schema, and click "Save Template" to get your `template.json`.

```json
// Your exported template.json
{
  "pageSettings": { "size": "a4", ... },
  "pages": [{
    "elements": [
      { "type": "Text", "text": "INVOICE", "x": 450, "y": 50, ... },
      { "type": "Table", "dataBinding": { "field": "items[]" }, ... }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Step 2: Generate Documents on Your Server

In your backend application, use the `` `@aavanamkit/engine` ``. Load the `template.json` you just created and feed it your live data.

```javascript
// Your backend API route (e.g., in an Express.js app)
import { generate } from '@aavanamkit/engine';
import template from './my-saved-template.json';

app.get('/api/invoices/:id/download', async (req, res) => {
  const liveData = await db.invoices.findOne({ id: req.params.id });

  const pdfBuffer = await generate({
    template: template,
    data: liveData,
    outputType: 'pdf'
  });

  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/pdf');
  res.send(pdfBuffer);
});

```
# The Bonus: Safe Client Empowerment

And if you want to go the extra mile, you can then embed the same `` `@aavanamkit/designer` `` component into your application's admin panel. This allows your clients to safely handle their own **visual** changes without ever needing to touch the underlying data structure.

**What clients *can* do:**
- Change element positions (move the logo, rearrange footer text).
- Adjust styling (font sizes, colors, bold/italics).
- Upload their own images, including using a scan of their **pre-printed stationery as a background** to perfectly align their design.

**What clients *cannot* do:**
- They **cannot** change the data schema or the data bindings. The core data structure is controlled by you, the developer, ensuring data integrity is always maintained.
